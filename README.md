## 🚀 How to Play
Two players take turns.

On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish.

Each roll adds its value to the current round score.

The player can choose to:

## ✅ Hold: Save the current round score to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.

## 🎲 Roll again: Take the risk to gain more round points.

## ❌ If a 1 is rolled: The player loses all round points and the turn immediately passes to the other player.

## 🏆 Objective
The first player to reach 100 total points wins the game!
